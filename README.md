# SHA256_clone

This package is a SHA256 clone. SHA256 means Secure Hashing Algorithm, with 256 bit output. 
Just how secure is this algorithm? Check out this awesome video by 3Blue1Brown on youtube:

Directions to running this algorithm:
1) Download each of the files into a new directory (folder)
2) In terminal, change your current working directory to the directory in step 1. Stay here for the rest of the steps
3) Compile the program by running the following command: javac SHA_256.java 
4) You are ready to create a hash with SHA256. Choose a message to hash, I'll use "abc" for this example
5) Run the following command in your terminal: java SHA_256 abc 
6) Your resulting hash will be printed to the terminal!
